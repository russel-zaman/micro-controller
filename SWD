Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is a two-wire protocol for accessing the ARM debug interface
It is part of the ARM Debug Interface Specification v5 and is an alternative to JTAG
The physical layer of SWD consists of two lines:
SWDIO: a bidirectional data line
SWCLK: a clock driven by the host
By using SWD interface, one can:
Program MCUs internal flash
Access memory regions
Add breakpoints
Stop/run CPU
The other good thing about SWD is that you can use the serial wire viewer for your printf statements for debugging.
