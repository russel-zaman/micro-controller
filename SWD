Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is a two-wire protocol for accessing the ARM debug interface
It is part of the ARM Debug Interface Specification v5 and is an alternative to JTAG
The physical layer of SWD consists of two lines:
SWDIO: a bidirectional data line
SWCLK: a clock driven by the host
By using SWD interface, one can:
Program MCUs internal flash
Access memory regions
Add breakpoints
Stop/run CPU
The other good thing about SWD is that you can use the serial wire viewer for your printf statements for debugging.




SWD and JTAG

JTAG was the traditional mechanism for debug connections for ARM7/9 family, but with the Cortex-M family,
ARM introduced the Serial Wire Debug (SWD) Interface.

SWD is designed to reduce the pin count required for debug from the 4 used by JTAG (excluding GND) down 
to 2. In addition, SWD interface provides one more pin called SWO(Serial Wire Output) which is used for 
Single Wire Viewing (SWV), which is a low cost tracing technology.
